public List<String> findClosestAddresses(File addresses, String hotelAddres) {}; 
The problem to solve was, how would you read the file and write the solution to find closest addresses to the given address. No API's given nothing, you basically can use whatever you want, I believe they want to see how you approach this problem. Again depends on which approach you choose and you and interviewer will decide on the file structure and how to extract the distance. Once you agree on this you start implementing the business logic for returning the List<String> of closest addresses
